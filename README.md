### The file system
1. ***sounds/***, it is the folder where all the sound files are stored (duh!!), you can change the **ding.mp3** for interesting results.
2. ***config_GUI.py*** , it is the GUI version of config.json (see I listen to advice)
3. ***data_funcs*** , it contains the data related functions.
4. ***config.json*** , it contains the configuration files for anyone boring enough to edit directly.
5. ***data.json*** , it is the file where each article is stored.
6. ***main.py*** , ............................  (end me) :tired_face:
7. ***notifier.py*** , contains the notification and speak functions.
8. ***setup.py*** , this is what you were supposed to run. I guess :sweat_smile:
9. ***wikipedia.png*** , :rage: At this point I don't even know why I am writing this..
